          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of currency that uses cryptography
            for security. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments (like USD or EUR),
            cryptocurrencies are decentralized and typically operate on blockchain technology.
            Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are popular examples.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">How Does It Work?</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Most cryptocurrencies operate on a blockchain â€” a decentralized and distributed ledger
            that records all transactions across a network of computers. This system ensures transparency,
            security, and immutability. Transactions are verified by participants in the network,
            often through a process called mining or staking.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Is It Safe?</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Crypto can be safe when proper precautions are taken. Use secure wallets, enable two-factor authentication (2FA),
            and avoid sharing your private keys. However, the market is highly volatile, and scams exist, so it's important
            to research before investing.
