// Since the existing code was omitted and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code uses 'it', 'is', 'and', 'correct', and 'brevity' without declaration or import.
// A common scenario is that these are used within a testing context (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
// Therefore, I will add a comment indicating that these variables are likely provided by a testing framework.
// If the code is NOT within a testing context, then appropriate imports or declarations would be needed.

// Example of how the code might look, assuming it's a placeholder loading component:

const Loading = () => {
  // Assuming 'it', 'is', 'and', 'correct', and 'brevity' are provided by a testing framework.
  // If not, they need to be declared or imported.

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Loading transactions...</p>
      {/* Example usage - remove if not relevant */}
      {/* {brevity && <p>Brief loading message</p>}
      {is && <p>Still loading...</p>}
      {it && <p>Processing...</p>}
      {correct && <p>Data is correct</p>}
      {and && <p>And more loading...</p>} */}
    </div>
  )
