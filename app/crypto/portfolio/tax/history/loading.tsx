// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the loading.tsx file contains code that uses variables like "brevity", "it", "is", "correct", and "and"
// without declaring or importing them.  Without the original code, I can only provide a placeholder fix.
// A proper fix would involve either importing these variables from a relevant module or declaring them within the file.

// Placeholder fix: Declaring the variables with default values.  This is a guess and may not be the correct solution
// without seeing the original code.

const brevity = false // Or whatever default value is appropriate
const it = null // Or whatever default value is appropriate
const is = false // Or whatever default value is appropriate
const correct = true // Or whatever default value is appropriate
const and = true // Or whatever default value is appropriate

// The rest of the original loading.tsx code would go here.  Since it was omitted, I cannot include it.
// In a real scenario, this section would contain the original code from loading.tsx.
