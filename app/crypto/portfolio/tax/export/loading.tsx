// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within a testing context (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
// Therefore, I will add a comment indicating that these variables are likely provided by the testing framework.
// If the variables are intended to be used outside of a testing context, further information would be needed to provide a more accurate solution.

// Assuming 'it', 'is', 'correct', 'and' are part of a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.
// These are usually provided globally by the testing environment.
// If they are not part of a testing framework, they need to be defined or imported.

// Example of how they might be used in a test (this is illustrative and might not be the actual usage):
// it('should handle brevity correctly', () => {
//   const brevity = true; // Example: brevity is used within this test scope
//   is(brevity).to.be.true; // Example: is is used for assertions
//   const correctValue = 123;
//   const andValue = 456;
//   is(correctValue + andValue).to.equal(579);
// });

// The original file content would go here. Since it was omitted, I'm adding a placeholder.
// Replace this with the actual content of app/crypto/portfolio/tax/export/loading.tsx

// Placeholder for the original file content:
const LoadingComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Loading indicator or message */}
      Loading...
    </div>
  )
}

export default LoadingComponent
