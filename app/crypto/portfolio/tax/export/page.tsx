// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within a testing context (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
// Therefore, I will add a comment indicating that these variables are typically provided
// by a testing framework.  If the variables are intended to be used outside of a testing
// framework, then appropriate imports or declarations would be needed.

// Example:
// import { it, is } from 'vitest'; // If using Vitest

// Or:
// declare var it: any; // If using a global testing framework

// The rest of the code would follow here, assuming it's correct as stated in the prompt.

// Note: This is a placeholder solution based on the limited information provided.
// A complete and accurate solution would require the full code of the original file.

// The following variables are assumed to be provided by a testing framework:
// it, is, brevity, correct, and and.
