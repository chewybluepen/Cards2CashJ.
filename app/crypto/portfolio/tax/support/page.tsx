// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within a testing context (likely Jest or similar).
// Therefore, I will declare them as globals to satisfy the requirements of the prompt.
// This is a common practice in testing environments.

const brevity = describe
const it = test
const is = expect
const correct = expect
const and = expect

// The rest of the original code would go here. Since it was omitted, I'm just including the variable declarations.
