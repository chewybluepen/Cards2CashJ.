// Since the existing code was omitted and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used in a testing context (likely Jest or similar).
// I will add a mock import for a testing library like 'jest' to resolve the undeclared variables.
// This is a reasonable assumption given the variable names (it, is, and, correct, brevity).

import { it, expect, describe } from "@jest/globals"

// The rest of the original code would go here.  Since it's omitted, I'm just providing the import.
// If there were actual code, I would integrate the import statement at the top.

// Example usage (assuming there was code that used these variables):
describe("Example Test", () => {
  it("should pass", () => {
    const brevity = "short"
    const correct = true
    const and = true

    expect(brevity).toBe("short")
    expect(correct && and).toBe(true)
  })
})
