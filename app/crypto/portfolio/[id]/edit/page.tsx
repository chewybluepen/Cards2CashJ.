// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity, and the updates indicate undeclared variables, I will assume the variables are used within a testing context (likely Jest or similar).  I will add a comment indicating this assumption and declare the variables with a type of `any` to resolve the errors.  If the actual code uses these variables differently, this will need to be adjusted.

// Assuming this is within a testing context (e.g., Jest)
// and these variables are implicitly available in that environment.
// Declaring them here to satisfy the type checker.

// Since the original code was omitted, I cannot provide a complete file.
// This is a placeholder to demonstrate how the undeclared variables would be handled.
